This is the logic for a rock-paper-scissors game.
The player chooses by typing game(choice), with "choice" being either "rock", "paper" or "scissors".
The computer will randomly make a choice and return the result.
If the game ends in a tie, it is not counted and play resumes until a winner is determined.
It keeps track of the score for the best 2 out of 3 games then resets.
